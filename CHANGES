# CHANGE LOG
#############################################################################

Version 0.69
 x Fix the handling of standard build types (for example libdoc) by fixing
   install_base return value when used as an accessor.
 x Undo the @ARGV stripping done by App::Options to allow Module::Build
   option processing to work as expected.

Version 0.68
 x Some test fixes for Perl 5.6.2 and when Archive::Extract/File::Fetch
   are not present.

Version 0.67
 x Rewritten mirror() to use File::Fetch.
 x Rewritten unpack() to use Archive::Extract.
 x Changed mirror() and unpack() into instance methods and use log_info()
   instead of print inside them.

Version 0.66
 x More comprehensive tests, remove unused code and some
   warnings.

Version 0.65
 x Fix some warnings when install_base is not specified.
 x Allow calling install_base after the App::Build object
   has been constructed.
 x Fix handling of the default 'dest_dir' attribute when
   'extra_dirs' is specified as an hash.
 x Fix compatibility with Module::Build 0.28 and require it.

Version 0.64
 x Do not use App::Build in App::Build's Build.PL because it breaks
   site/vendor selection operated (for example) by Gentoo g-cpan.

Version 0.63

Version 0.62
 x Ensure that SVN files (files in */.svn) are not copied/installed

Version 0.60
 x Remove "Build" from @ARGV to get around weirdness with CPAN shell

 x install scripts into $PREFIX/bin, not $PREFIX/scripts.
 x override has_config_data() to always return false to overcome weirdness
 x added regression tests (t/main.t)
 x add the "execute" attribute on "extra_dirs"
 x adds execute permission only to #! files in dirs that contain executables

Version 0.50
 x Cause "bin" directories (i.e. cgi-bin) to have perl interpreter substitution
 x Ensure execute permission set on "bin" directories
 x Properly write the .packlist (right location, right contents, right format)
 x Ensure that packlist is written when no "module_name" exists
 x Ensure that CVS and RCS files are not copied/installed

Version 0.10
 x Initial release
 x Cause extra_dirs to be installed
 x Add configure() hook
 x Ensure that "lib" is always at the head of @INC
