1. What is the App-Build distribution?

App::Build is a module which extends Module::Build.
It is used to install whole applications rather than merely
perl modules.

2. What are the features?

FEATURES OF App::Build

 o determines PREFIX for installed application (install_base)
 o extra_dirs - install other directories full of files to PREFIX
    o don't install RCS and CVS files
    o fix shebang line selectively
 o write .packlist
 o add a configure() hook which can be overridden in a subclass of App::Build

ASSUMPTIONS OF App::Build

 o PREFIX/htdocs is for static, web-viewable files (html, images, css, js)
 o PREFIX/cgi-bin is for CGI programs

CORRECTIONS OF MISFEATURES IN Module::Build and CPAN

 o unset PREFIX variable if supplied so no warning occurs (Module::Build)
 o alias PREFIX to install_base rather than complain about it (Module::Build)
 o install bin/* to $PREFIX/bin rather than $PREFIX/scripts
 o handle "perl Build.PL Build" (CPAN.pm)

FUTURE FEATURES OF App::Build

 o write /usr/local/lib/perl5/<version>/<arch>/perllocal.pod
 o download/unpack perl applications not on CPAN
 o do better job at detecting DocumentDir rather than PREFIX/htdocs
 o do better job at detecting ScriptDir rather than PREFIX/cgi-bin
 o pure perl support for downloading external source archives (not on CPAN)
 o pure perl support for unpacking external source archives
